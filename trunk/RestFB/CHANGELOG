1.6.5 (July X, 2011)

* All types under com.restfb.types now implement Serializable.
  Thanks to everyone who asked for this!
* Added "comments", "likes", "position", and "images" fields to Photo.
  Thanks to Andre Oosthuizen and Grace Win.
* Added "name", "tags", and "source" fields to Video and marked "message" as deprecated.
  Thanks to Andre Oosthuizen and Marcel Stoer.
* Added "likes" and "access_token" fields to Page and deprecated "fan_count".  
  Thanks to Shashank Agarwal and jspyeatt.
* Added "object_id" field to Post.
  Thanks to Grace Win.

1.6.4 (March 5, 2011)

* Added "application" and "type" fields to Post.
  Thanks to nelrib.
* Removed "mobilePhone" and "address" fields from User.
  Thanks to Marcel Stoer.
* Added undocumented "properties" field to Post type.
  
1.6.3 (February 19, 2011)

* RestFB now automatically uses the faster read-only endpoints for Graph and Old REST API calls when possible.
  Thanks to Dmitry Naumenko for the suggestion.
* POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: Old REST API calls (including FQL with the Graph API) will now throw
  FacebookOAuthException instead of FacebookResponseStatusException when error code 190 is encountered.
  Thanks to Ofer Fort for the suggestion.
* It is now simple to customize how RestFB maps Facebook error responses to FacebookException instances
  for both Graph and Old REST API errors by overriding DefaultFacebookClient.createGraphFacebookExceptionMapper() and
  BaseFacebookClient.createLegacyFacebookExceptionMapper(), respectively.  The default instances returned
  by both of these methods are now marked protected instead of anonymous classes so you can leverage them if you wish.
  Thanks to Alexis Dufrenoy for the suggestion.
* Added lots of new fields to User, e.g "sports" and "languages".
  Thanks to Patrick Alberts for the patch.
* Added new PageConnection type, useful for mapping partial page types returned by some connections, e.g. "me/music".
  Thanks to Patrick Alberts for the patch.
* Added undocumented "is_community_page" and "description" fields to the Page type.
  Thanks to Ivan Viragine.
* Can now customize HttpURLConnection creation in DefaultWebRequestor by overriding openConnection(URL url)
  to support custom proxying etc.
  Thanks to Matti Haro for the suggestion.
* Added new Insight type which can be used like this:
  Connection<Insight> insights = facebookClient.fetchConnection("PAGE_ID/insights", Insight.class);
    
1.6.2 (January 23, 2011)

* You can now instruct DefaultJsonMapper how to handle mapping exceptions, e.g.
  ignoring them and mapping as null instead of throwing an exception. 

	FacebookClient facebookClient = new DefaultFacebookClient("MY_ACCESS_TOKEN",
	  new DefaultWebRequestor(), new DefaultJsonMapper(new JsonMappingErrorHandler() {
	    public boolean handleMappingError(String unmappableJson, Class<?> targetType, Exception e) {      
	      // Here you might log the fact that JSON mapping failed.      
	      err.println(format("Uh oh, mapping %s to %s failed...", unmappableJson, targetType));
	
	      // Returning true tells the mapper to map this JSON as null and keep going.
	      // Returning false tells the mapper to throw an exception.      
	      return true;
	    }
	  }));
  
  The default behavior is still to throw an exception immediately on mapping errors,
  this callback interface is your way of saying "I know what I'm doing and want to
  handle errors myself".  Very useful for keeping your app running in production
  when Facebook changes the API unexpectedly.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the suggestion.   
* Added new "quotes" and "address" and "mobile_phone" fields to the User type.
  Thanks to ne52 for the heads-up about the addition of the quotes field.
* DateUtils.toDateFromMonthYearFormat now returns null for "0000-00" instead of 0 AD.
  Not sure why FB gives us 0000-00 instead of null in some situations, e.g. work start date.

1.6.1 (unofficial release)

* We're now fully Mavenized - you can add RestFB to your Maven project like this:

	<dependency>
	  <groupId>com.restfb</groupId>
	  <artifactId>restfb</artifactId>
	  <version>1.6.2</version>
	</dependency>

  Many thanks to Kalle Korhonen, and congratulations to him for being the first additional RestFB committer!
* JsonException is now unchecked.
* Fix for start and end date handling on the Event type.
  Thanks to Jason Peltzer.
* @Facebook annotation on accessToken on Account type is now correctly mapped to "access_token".
  Thanks to Scott Aaron.
* Added the "category" field to the Checkin.Place type.
  Thanks to Mattia Tommasone.
* Latitude and Longitude fields on Checkin.Place are now of type Double instead of Float,
  thereby supporting the full precision of the data returned by FB instead of truncating to fit correctly in a Float.

1.6 (December 30, 2010)

* POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: User.getPicture() has been removed.
  To get the user's picture, simply construct a URL by hand, e.g. http://graph.facebook.com/USER_ID/picture
* Now use java.util.logging instead of Log4j - RestFB now has 0 dependencies.
* FacebookException now extends RuntimeException - you no longer have to catch it if you don't want to.
  Thanks to Jeff Schnitzer.
* Removed "contains" attribute on @Facebook annotation since it is no longer necessary.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the initial patch.
* Exposed and cleaned up previously-internal RestFB's repackaged JSON.org code in the new com.restfb.json package.
* You may now tell JsonMapper to map to JsonObject, which permits you to have total control over result mapping at run time
  (as opposed to the compile-time-only @Facebook annotation).
* JsonMapper now supports having a Facebook JSON field mapped to multiple @Facebook-annotated Java fields.
  This addresses the issue of Facebook returning the same field name but differently-structured data in certain situations.
  See issues 56 and 90 for details.
  Thanks to Daniel Winterstein, Igor Kabiljo, Marcel Stoer, Pramod Biligiri, and Tom Schindl for their input.
* Exposed and cleaned up previously-internal RestFB utilities in the new com.restfb.util package. 
* Added new exception package com.restfb.exception and exception types
  (FacebookOAuthException, FacebookQueryParseException) for simple handling of common Graph API exception types.
  Thanks to Jeff Schnitzer.
* Added formal support for Connection paging by URL via FacebookClient.fetchConnectionPage() and the new Connection.getPreviousPageUrl()/getNextPageUrl().
  No more manual offset calculation required.  Example:
  
  Connection<Post> myFeed = facebookClient.fetchConnection("me/feed", Post.class);

  if(myFeed.hasNext()) {
    Connection<Post> myFeedPage2 = facebookClient.fetchConnectionPage(myFeed.getNextPageUrl(), Post.class);
    ...
  }
  
  Thanks to Jakub Danilewicz.
* Added FacebookClient.convertSessionKeysToAccessTokens() method.
  Thanks to Scott Hernandez and Mattia Tommasone. 
* Fixed issue where User.birthday causes mapping to fail if "show only month & date" is set on FB.
  Thanks to Kalle Korhonen.
* Old REST API now always uses the HTTPS endpoint.
  Thanks to Christopher Oestlund.
* Added embed_html, picture, icon, comments to Video type.
  Thanks to Fahd Akbar and Chris Pruett.
* Added Account type to support impersonation feature.
  Thanks to jovanovich.
* Fixed error-handling issues: 1) where HTTP 400 error code would throw an incorrect exception and 2) where error response JSON would not get
  correctly read in this and other error situations.
	Thanks to Igor Kabiljo, ovonick, and everyone else who reported this.
* Performance enhancement: ReflectionUtils now caches @Facebook field information so we never have to reflect more than once.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the patch.
* Added Checkin type.
  Thanks to everyone else who requested this and Colin Britton for the checkin code snippet.
* Added StatusMessage type.
* Added middle_name field to User type.
  Thanks to Fehmican Saglam.

1.5.4 (September 16, 2010)
* Post comment type now handles case where FB returns an empty array instead of an object type.
  Thanks to Pipo, CR, S13_Alan, Igor Kabiljo, and Jakub Danilewicz.

1.5.3 (July 21, 2010)
* NamedFacebookType now handles situation where FB returns, for example,
  "hometown":"Beograd", instead of the expected "hometown":{"id":123,"name":"Belgrade, Serbia"}
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report and suggested fix.
* Mapper now gracefully handles situation where Facebook returns the not-JSON string "false" and instead of {}.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report and suggested fix.
* The Post type's comments field changed on the Facebook side to include a "count" field.
  Thanks to Jakub Danilewicz for the bug report and suggested fix.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the suggested fix.    
* Fixed infinite recursion bug that was triggerable in exceptional situations in ReflectionUtils.toString().
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report and suggested fix.
* Mapper fix for situations where Facebook returns the string "null" instead of an empty object or nothing.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report.
* Timezone field in User is now a Double to account for timezones with fractional offsets.
  Thanks to Sam for the bug report.
* Changed Parameter's date marshaling to produce Facebook Date strings in a zero-based hour format.
  Thanks to Jakub Danilewicz for the bug report and suggested fix.
* Connection<?> has getNext() and getPrevious() methods that return the next/previous URLs returned by Facebook.
* All fields in BaseFacebookClient, DefaultFacebookClient, and DefaultLegacyFacebookClient are protected for easier subclassing.
  All Facebook API URLs are now overridable via protected accessor methods.
  Thanks to Kalle Korhonen and bijuphilip0 for the enhancement requests.
* Added locale field to User.

1.5.2 (June 8, 2010)
* No longer require an access token for the Graph API (now have a default constructor for DefaultFacebookClient).
