1.6 (December 30, 2010)

* Now use java.util.logging instead of Log4j - RestFB now has 0 dependencies.
* FacebookException now extends RuntimeException - you no longer have to catch it if you don't want to.
  Thanks to Jeff Schnitzer.
* Removed "contains" attribute on @Facebook annotation since it is no longer necessary.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the initial patch.
* Exposed and cleaned up previously-internal RestFB's repackaged JSON.org code in the new com.restfb.json package.
* You may now tell JsonMapper to map to JsonObject, which permits you to have total control over result mapping at run time
  (as opposed to the compile-time-only @Facebook annotation).
* JsonMapper now supports having a Facebook JSON field mapped to multiple @Facebook-annotated Java fields.
  This addresses the issue of Facebook returning the same field name but differently-structured data in certain situations.
  See issues 56 and 90 for details.
  Thanks to Daniel Winterstein, Igor Kabiljo, Marcel Stoer, Pramod Biligiri, and Tom Schindl for their input.
* Exposed and cleaned up previously-internal RestFB utilities in the new com.restfb.util package. 
* Added new exception package com.restfb.exception and exception types
  (FacebookOAuthException, FacebookQueryParseException) for simple handling of common Graph API exception types.
  Thanks to Jeff Schnitzer.
* Added formal support for Connection paging by URL via FacebookClient.fetchConnectionPage() and the new Connection.getPreviousPageUrl()/getNextPageUrl().
  No more manual offset calculation required.  Example:
  
  Connection<Post> myFeed = facebookClient.fetchConnection("me/feed", Post.class);

  if(myFeed.hasNext()) {
    Connection<Post> myFeedPage2 = facebookClient.fetchConnectionPage(myFeed.getNextPageUrl(), Post.class);
    ...
  }
  
  Thanks to Jakub Danilewicz.
* Added FacebookClient.convertSessionKeysToAccessTokens() method.
  Thanks to Scott Hernandez and raibaz. 
* Fixed issue where User.birthday causes mapping to fail if "show only month & date" is set on FB.
  Thanks to Kalle Korhonen.
* Old REST API now always uses the HTTPS endpoint.
  Thanks to Christopher Oestlund.
* Added embed_html, picture, icon, comments to Video type.
  Thanks to Fahd Akbar and Chris Pruett.
* Added Account type to support impersonation feature.
  Thanks to jovanovich.
* Fixed error-handling issues: 1) where HTTP 400 error code would throw an incorrect exception and 2) where error response JSON would not get
  correctly read in this and other error situations.
	Thanks to Igor Kabiljo, ovonick, and everyone else who reported this.
* Performance enhancement: ReflectionUtils now caches @Facebook field information so we never have to reflect more than once.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the patch.
* Added Checkin type.
  Thanks to everyone else who requested this and Colin Britton for the checkin code snippet.
* Added StatusMessage type.
* Added middle_name field to User type.
  Thanks to Fehmican Saglam.

1.5.4 (September 16, 2010)

  Thanks to Pipo, CR, S13_Alan, Igor Kabiljo, and Jakub Danilewicz.

1.5.3 (July 21, 2010)

  "hometown":"Beograd", instead of the expected "hometown":{"id":123,"name":"Belgrade, Serbia"}
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report and suggested fix.
* Mapper now gracefully handles situation where Facebook returns the not-JSON string "false" and instead of {}.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report and suggested fix.

  Thanks to Jakub Danilewicz for the bug report and suggested fix.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the suggested fix.    
* Fixed infinite recursion bug that was triggerable in exceptional situations in ReflectionUtils.toString().
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report and suggested fix.
* Mapper fix for situations where Facebook returns the string "null" instead of an empty object or nothing.
  Thanks to Igor Kabiljo for the bug report.
* Timezone field in User is now a Double to account for timezones with fractional offsets.
  Thanks to Sam for the bug report.
* Changed Parameter's date marshaling to produce Facebook Date strings in a zero-based hour format.
  Thanks to Jakub Danilewicz for the bug report and suggested fix.
* Connection<?> has getNext() and getPrevious() methods that return the next/previous URLs returned by Facebook.
* All fields in BaseFacebookClient, DefaultFacebookClient, and DefaultLegacyFacebookClient are protected for easier subclassing.
  All Facebook API URLs are now overridable via protected accessor methods.
  Thanks to Kalle Korhonen and bijuphilip0 for the enhancement requests.
* Added locale field to User.

* Old REST API now has support for the new OAuth authentication tokens
* Fix for multiqueries with empty resultsets throwing a JSON mapping exception
